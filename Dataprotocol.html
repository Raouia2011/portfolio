      <h4>3. General information and mandatory information</h4>
      <h4>Privacy</h4>
      <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal

        also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>

      <p>
        We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have
        security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.

      </p>
      <h4>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h4>
      <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent that you
        have
        already given at any time. An informal message by e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the data
        processing
        that took place up until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
      <h2>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h2>

      <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO
        THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN
        THIS DATA PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR CONCERNED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
        PROVE COMPREHENSIVE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OBJECTION
        ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 21 (1) GDPR).</p>
      <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE
        PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE
        EXTENT RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT
        ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 (2) GDPR).</p>
      <h2>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h2>
      <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of
        the
        alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial
        remedy.</p>
      <h2>Right to data portability</h2>
      <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of
        a
        contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
        transfer of the data to another person responsible, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically
        feasible.</p>
      <h2>SSL or TLS encryption</h2>
      <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that
        you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted
        connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock
        symbol in your browser line.</p>

      <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
      <h2>Information, deletion and correction</h2>
      <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your
        stored
        personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to
        correction or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the
        imprint if you have any further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>

        any
        time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. For the
          duration of the examination, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be
          restricted.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of
          data processing instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you
          have
          the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted instead of being deleted.</li>
        <li>If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 (1) GDPR, your interests and ours must be weighed
          up. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand that the
          processing of your personal data be restricted.</li>


      </ol>
      <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be

        advertising and information material. The site operators expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the
        event of unsolicited advertising being sent, such as spam e-mails.</p>

        Limited
        ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>

      <p>Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and that
        enable
        an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website
        is
        usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>

      <p>The storage of Google Analytics cookies and the use of this analysis tool are based on Article 6 Paragraph 1
        lit.
        f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its
        website and its advertising. If a corresponding consent was requested (e.g. consent to the storage of cookies),
        the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. the consent can be revoked at
        any time.</p>
      <h2>IP anonymization</h2>
      <p>We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. As a result, your IP address will be shortened
        by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the
        European Economic Area before it is transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address
        be
        sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will
        use
        this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide
        other
        services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by
        your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.</p>
      <h2>Browser Plugin</h2>
      <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; we would like to point out
        to you however that in this case you will if applicable not be able to use all functions of this website in
        full.

          https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</a>.</p>
      <h2>order processing</h2>
      <p>We have concluded an order processing contract with Google and fully implement the strict requirements of the
        German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
      <h2>Demographic characteristics in Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>This website uses the "demographic characteristics" function of Google Analytics. This allows reports to be
        created that contain statements about the age, gender and interests of the site visitors. This data comes from

        to a specific person. You can deactivate this function at any time via the ad settings in your Google account or
        generally prohibit the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the point "Objection to data
